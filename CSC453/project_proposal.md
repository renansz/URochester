## Project Proposal ##

### Python AST Visualization Tool ###

<b>Goal:</b> Make a pytutor alike tool that shows step-by-step how Python's interpreter parse the code into AST and executes it.

<b> Ideas: </b>
  - Use a animated graphic representation for the AST generated from a specif compiled code.
  - Dinamically generate the tree and the all the steps the compiler take when process it.


<b> Implementation: </b>
  - Make a example of this representation with a algebric expression.
