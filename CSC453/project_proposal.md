### Python AST Visualization Tool ###

<b>Goal:</b> Make a pytutor alike tool that can show how the AST executes python code.

Ideas:
  - Use a animated graphic representation for the AST generated from a specif compiled code.
  - Dinamically generate the tree and the all the steps the compiler take when process it.


Implementation:
  - Make a example of this representation with a algebric expression.
  - Make at least a video or an environment that is able to show the idea and functionalities of this AST visualization tool
